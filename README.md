# Game-of-Thrones-Quiz-App
Built a Game of Thrones Quiz using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with visual effects such as hover effects, background images, and colour schemes inspired by the show. Implemented multiple-choice questions and a score-tracking system to enhance user experience. I added a "save score" option for users to view their past quiz results. This quiz offers an interactive way for fans to test their knowledge of the Game of Thrones universe using IT tools and techniques.
