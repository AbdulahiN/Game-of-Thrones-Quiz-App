# Game-of-Thrones-Quiz-App

Developed an interactive Game of Thrones-themed quiz application employing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, featuring immersive visual effects such as hover interactions and thematic background images. The design integrates a color palette reflective of the series' aesthetic. The quiz structure comprises multiple-choice questions, accompanied by a dynamic scoring mechanism to engage and challenge users. Additionally, I incorporated a feature to save quiz scores, allowing users to track their progress over time. This project demonstrates my proficiency in creating user-centric, engaging web applications while leveraging modern web development practices.
